2.2.4
 - fix: UI slot issues (probably a racing condition) in the
   analysis view; editing the viscosity for "other" medium not
   possible on frozen Windows and macOS application (#49) 
2.2.3
 - fix: update Quick View plot when values for the Young's modulus
   computation are changed (#44)
 - fix: use fixed point size in Block Matrix
 - enh: improve plot matrix column/row visualization and show flow
   rate (#45)
 - docs: update visualization of Young's modulus look-up tables
   using new figure script from dclab
 - build: bump Python to 3.8 for Windows builds
 - setup: bump dclab from 0.27.5 to 0.27.11 (improvement of hierarchy
   child handling)
2.2.2
 - fix: correct box filter ranges when feature contains inf values
 - enh: add pretty tool icons from KDE breeze theme
2.2.1
 - fix: zero-division error when setting "one plot per dataset"
   for an empty plot (#41)
 - build: pin PyQt5 to 5.14.2 on Linux/macOS
2.2.0
 - setup: bump dclab from 0.26.2 to 0.27.5 (support for machine
   learning features)
 - fix: modify the GUI to enable box filtering for ml_score_???
   features
 - ref: pipeline.get_features now only returns features that are
   available (previously all features were returned when no
   datasets were in the pipeline)
2.1.6
 - fix: export file names were allowed to have invalid characters
 - fix: Quick View showed filtered events that were not plotted
   (statistics were computed correctly though)
 - fix: Quick View was not very informative when all events were
   filtered away - a message is now shown
 - setup: bump dclab from 0.26.1 to 0.26.2 (fix bin num computation
   using Doane's formula)
2.1.5
 - fix: marker hue feature data min/max was always computed even if
   not selected; for datasets without bright_avg (standard hue) this
   resulted in long waiting times
 - fix: avoid pyqtgraph error messages in pipeline plots by disabling
   hovering events (not used anyway)
 - fix: plot export did not work for single plots
 - fix: exported event images sometimes had wrong contrast
2.1.4
 - enh: add busy cursors wherever it seems fitting
 - setup: bump dclab from 0.24.7 to 0.26.1 (volume-deformation
   isoelasticity lines, improved DCOR caching)
2.1.3
 - fix: opening sessions did not work due to missing slot decorator
 - fix: in some cases the temperature/viscosity setting was not
   correctly written to the UI for individual slots when switching
   between slots with fundamentally different settings (e.g. channel
   and reservoir)
 - fix: KeyError when switching between slots with different
   temperature options
 - setup: bump dclab from 0.23.0 to 0.24.7 (equidistant isoelastics,
   faster polygon filtering, crosstalk correction failed due to
   improper configuration update since Shape-Out 2.1.1)
2.1.2
 - fix: ValueError when trying to compute contour spacing, because no
   datasets are selected for a plot
 - fix: coloring scatter plot by feature did not work when the feature
   contains nan values
 - fix: search path in session should not be filename but its
   directory
 - setup: bump dclab from 0.22.5 to 0.23.0 (possible HDF5 export issue)
2.1.1
 - fix: include private datasets when searching with DCOR API Key
 - fix: remove UI option to compute Young's modulus for reservoir data
   (new "emodulus enabled" key in pipeline slot)
 - fix: `Pipeline` object not returned by `session.open_session`
 - setup: bump dclab from 0.22.1 to 0.22.5 (improve contour retrieval
   for mask images with artefacts, disable computation of Young's
   modulus for reservoir measurements)
2.1.0
 - feat: basic DCOR support
 - fix: improved session support (older pre-release sessions)
 - docs: add DCOR guick guide 
 - enh: export event image via context menu in Quick View (#35)
 - setup: bump dclab from 0.21.1 to 0.22.1 (DCOR support)
2.0.3
 - setup: bump dclab from 0.20.3 to 0.21.1
 - docs: add terminology section (#12)
2.0.2
 - fix: IndexError when removing a plot (#36)
 - fix: ValueError when filtering all events in Quick View (#37)
 - fix: TypeError when removing datasets and opening Quick View (#38)
 - fix: RuntimeError when removing datasets and opening Quick View (#38)
 - fix: ValueError when removing activated datasets and opening Quick View
2.0.1
 - fix: correctly distinguish prereleases when checking for new versions
 - enh: allow loading data via drag&drop
2.0.0
 - initial release
