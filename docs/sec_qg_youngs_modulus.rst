Young's Modulus

With Shape-Out, it is possible to convert deformation values to values
of the Young's modulus based on numerical simulation for
fully elastic spheres according to Mokbel et al. :cite:`Mokbel2017`.

The "Calculate" tab  allows you to obtain
the Young's modulus for the samples in the current analysis.
After choosing the type of measurement medium you must set the
right temperature or – in case you choose "Other" – the correct
viscosity. For CellCarrier media, the correct viscosity is
automatically calculated, taking shear-thinning
into account as discussed in :cite:`Herold2017`.

Once "Compute elastic modulus" is clicked, the Young's modulus will become
available for plotting and data analysis.

**Validity**:

The computation of the Young's modulus is valid only for objects that
initially have a spherical shape. In addition, the deformation and
size values must be in a "valid region". Events outside this region will
have a *nan*-valued (not a number) Young's modulus. Note that as a result,
these events will be excluded from all plots when *remove invalid events*
is checked in the *Filter* configuration tab.

    Visualizations of the support and the values of the look-up table (LUT)
    used for determining the Young's modulus from deformation and
    cell area. The values of the Young's moduli in the regions
    shown depend on the channel size, the flow rate, the temperature,
    and the viscosity of the medium :cite:`Mietke2015`.
    Here, they are computed for a 15 µm wide channel at 24°C with an
    effective pixel size of 0.34 µm. The data are corrected for pixelation
    effects according to :cite:`Herold2017`.

The invalid regions (white in the figure above) include objects that
are very small or objects with very low deformation values.
The reason for that is a very steep increase of the Young's modulus with
little decrease in deformation that could potentially result in very large
simulation errors. In addition, regions with high deformation are invalid as well,
because the simulations do not converge (objects simulated with
lower Young's moduli  become more and more elongated until they rupture).
In practice, this means that the channel size has to be selected carefully
to match the object sizes. Larger object sizes require wider channels
if meaningful values for the Young's modulus are to be computed.


In the following, additional visualizations for commonly used channel sizes
and flow rates are shown:
